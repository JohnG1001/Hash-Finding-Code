# Hash-Finding-Code

*The code used was apart of the Python practical used in the Evolve Security Academy final test.*

The python code was used to iterate through a specified directory in order to find a targeted hash. The directory was filled with over hundreds of ".txt" files of MD5 hashes. The code compiled used the "os" library to go through a directory, create each file into a binary read format, compare to the md5 hash in binary, find the correct file, and then list the file path to the correct hashed file.
